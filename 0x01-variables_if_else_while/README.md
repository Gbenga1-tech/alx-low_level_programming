0-This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.if the number is greater than 0: is positive -if the number is 0: is zero -if the number is less than 0: is negative
1- program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. -if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5 -if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 -if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
2- a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.       -ou can only use the putchar function
3-a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.       -You can only use the putchar function
4-a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.      -Print all the letters except q and e -You can only use the putchar
